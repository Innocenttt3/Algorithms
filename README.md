# Algorithms

Welcome to the Algorithms Repository for the 3rd semester of Computer Science at UMCS.

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C++. Most of the tasks have successfully passed the verification of the testing platform. Additionally, solutions to all mock and final exams are provided.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following:

- Priority queues
- Binary heaps
- Binary trees
- All types of linked lists
- Stable and unstable sorting algorithms
- Graph implementations
- Divide and conquer approaches
- Dynamic programming
- Backtracking algorithms

## Notes

Please note that while most tasks have been verified, it's always a good practice to test the algorithms thoroughly in different scenarios.
